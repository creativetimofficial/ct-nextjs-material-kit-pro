### Warning

_We could not update webpack past version 4 and node-sass past version 5 due to some warnings from NextJS._
_The following warnings come from some of our dependencies, however they do not affect the UI or the functionality of the product - we are thinking of dropping their usage and replace with other dependencies:_

```
npm WARN react-animate-on-scroll@2.1.5 requires a peer of react@>= 15.4.1 < 17.0.0-0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
npm WARN react-datetime@3.0.4 requires a peer of react@^16.5.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
npm WARN react-tagsinput@3.19.0 requires a peer of react@^16.0.0 || ^15.0.0 || ^0.14.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
npm WARN react-swipeable@5.5.1 requires a peer of react@^16.0.0-0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.

### Warning

_The following warnings come from some of our dependencies, however they do not affect the UI or the functionality of the product - if the issues will perssit and will change into errors in the next version of React (v17), we will drop their usage and replace with other dependencies:_

```
npm WARN deprecated popper.js@1.16.1: Popper changed home, find its new releases at @popperjs/core
npm WARN deprecated request@2.88.2: request has been deprecated, see https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142
npm WARN deprecated mkdirp@0.5.3: Legacy versions of mkdirp are no longer supported. Please update to mkdirp 1.x. (Note that the API surface has changed to use Promises in 1.x.)
npm WARN deprecated core-js@2.6.11: core-js@<3 is no longer maintained and not recommended for usage due to the number of issues. Please, upgrade your dependencies to the actual version of core-js@3.
```

_The following dependencies raise warnings (of deprecation or renamed) in develpment mode: Component, DateTime, ReactSwipableView, TagsInput, withGoogleMap(Component), withScriptjs(withGoogleMap(Component)). If the warnings will perssit, and will become errors in React 17, we will drop their usage and replace them with other plugins._
